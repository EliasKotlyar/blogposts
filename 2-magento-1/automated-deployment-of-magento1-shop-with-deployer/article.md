Intro: Putting every change to webservers can be an annoying job. To ensure same procedure every time you deploy, you could automate this process. Let me show how to with deployer.org

Text: Bringing new version of your code base may be an annoying job for you and your team if you don't have a specialist DevOps in your team. To ensure you process your deployment every time with same procedure, you could use a specific tool for that job. Especially after some Magento-Core updates it is a good way to deploy your code with one of these tools.

## why using a deployment tool?

There are a lot of deployment tools in the wild. Some automate more or less than others, most use different programming languages, some need a root-server to deploy to other machines. Big **benefit** of these tools are **speed**, **consistency**, **rollbacks** and sometime **parallel deployments**. If you are working as team on a projects, you can guarantee that **everyone deploys code the same way**.

# why deployer.org?

I decided to use [deployer](https://deployer.org/) as this tool come in our native programming language **PHP**. It is simple to install, learn and to use. It also brings some out-of-the-box recipes with it. You could also create your own recipes and share them with your team on VCS.

# typical deployment tasks:

Let's think about tasks, that you have/had to do on every deployment:

- choose server, login
- go to webserver directory
- create folder structure for your project
- separate folder/files that will be used in every deployment
- collect and build your new code
- create symlinks for folder and files
- clear caches folder, flush database cache, invalid cache files

# create your magento deployer recipe

As mentioned earlier, deployer.org brings some recipes with it. One of these recipes if for default Magento1 Shop: [View recipe on Github](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/magento.php)

This gives us a good base to work on.

First we define our [servers](https://deployer.org/docs/servers)

(code lang: php)
server('prod_1', 'domain.com')
    ->user('user')
    ->password('pass')
    ->set('deploy_path', '/home/www')
    ->stage('production');
(code)

or in an external file with YAML:

(code lang: yaml)
prod:
  host: domain.com
  user: www
  identity_file: ~
  stage: production
  deploy_path: /home/www/
 (code)
 
 After that we build our first recipe:
 Most of our desired tasks are covered by [common.php](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/common.php) recipe and [magento.php](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/magento.php) recipe. Therefore we extend the existing Magento-Recipe:
 
 (code lang: php)
 <?php
 
 require 'recipes/magento.php';
 
 #import serverlist
 serverList('config/servers.yaml');

# deployer tasks run as root. We'd like to fix rights:
task('fix-rights', function () {
    $httpUser = get('http_user');

    if (null === $httpUser) {
        $httpUser = run("ps axo user,comm | grep -E '[a]pache|[h]ttpd|[_]www|[w]ww-data|[n]ginx' | grep -v root | head -1 | cut -d\  -f1")->toString();
    }
    #runs as root
    run('chown -R ' . $httpUser . ':' . $httpUser . ' {{deploy_path}}');
});

#We'd like to fix rights after deployment/cleanup and after rollback:
after('cleanup', 'fix-rights');
after('rollback', 'fix-rights');


#Now we define deployment of our git-based code:
task('set-shop-repository', function () {
    set('repository', 'https://github.com/firegento/magento.git');
});

task('deploy-flexstores', [
    'set-shop-repository',
    'deploy'
]);
 (code)
